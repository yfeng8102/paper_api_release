The capsules are fabricated by the self-assembly of colloidal particles onto the interface of emulsion droplets. After the particles are locked together to form elastic shells, the emulsion droplets are transferred to a fresh continuous-phase fluid that is the same as that inside the droplets. The resultant structures, which we call “colloidosomes,” are hollow, elastic shells whose permeability and elasticity can be precisely controlled. The generality and robustness of these structures and their potential for cellular immunoisolation are demonstrated by the use of a variety of solvents, particles, and contents.},

Rather than developing new algorithms specific to population balance equations, it is proposed to adapt the high‐resolution finite volume methods developed for compressible gas dynamics, which have been applied to aerodynamics, astrophysics, detonation waves, and related fields where shock waves occur. High‐resolution algorithms are presented for simulating multidimensional population balance equations with nucleation and size‐dependent growth rates. For sharp distributions, these high‐resolution algorithms can achieve improved numerical accuracy with orders‐of‐magnitude lower computational cost than other finite difference and finite volume algorithms. The algorithms are implemented in the ParticleSolver software package, which is applied to batch and continuous processes with one and multiple internal coordinates. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 2738–2749, 2004},

The versatility of stabilising particles and their ability to encapsulate and release cargo with high internal payload capacity makes them attractive in a wide variety of applications, ranging from catalysis to the cosmetic and food industry. While these properties make them an equally promising material platform for pharmaceutical and clinical applications, the development of Pickering emulsions for healthcare is still in its infancy. Herein, we summarise and discuss recent progress in the development of Pickering emulsions for biomedical applications, probing their design for passive diffusion-based release as well as stimuli-responsive destabilisation.

  abstract = {Pickering emulsions, in which solid colloidal particles assume the stabilizing role typically performed by surfactants, have witnessed rapid growth in food research and development. Their irreversible adsorption at the oil–water interface produces robust droplet “armors” that withstand temperature shifts, shear forces, and pH extremes, making them an appealing option across various product sectors. In food research, the past five years have brought notable progress in harnessing plant and biopolymer-based particles to address challenges of saturated fat reduction, extended shelf life, and controlled release of sensitive ingredients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotics. These advances have yielded important findings in dairy applications—particularly for low-fat ice creams, yogurts, and nutrient-fortified milk analogs—as well as in baked goods, confectionery products, and emerging plant-based meat analogs requiring structured fat mimetics. Alongside fundamental insights into interfacial rheology and the kinetic stability of particle-laden droplets, investigations have explored regulatory perspectives, including GRAS/QPS status and allergen labeling, to facilitate larger-scale adoption. This review captures both the foundational science behind Pickering stabilization and the recent breakthroughs in product formulation, highlighting specific examples of enhanced texture, functional ingredient retention, and clean-label appeal. By assembling these diverse strands of research, it clarifies how Pickering emulsions have become a versatile, far-reaching strategy for safer, more sustainable, and increasingly functional food innovations.},

Chemical Engineering Science, 61, 3327–3342] is extended to solving multi-dimensional population balance equations. Similar to the one-dimensional case, the scheme is based on an accurate prediction of certain moments of the population. The formulation is quite simple to implement, computationally not expensive and highly accurate. Numerical diffusion is a common problem with many numerical methods when applied on coarse grids. The presented technique nearly eliminates numerical diffusion and predicts four moments (zeroth, first, first cross and second) of the distribution function with high accuracy. The technique may be implemented on any type of grid. The accuracy of the scheme has been analyzed by comparing analytical and numerical solutions of three test problems. The numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical results and show the ability to predict higher moments very precisely. Additionally, an extension of the proposed technique to higher dimensional problems is discussed.},

Key aspects discussed include stabilization via solid particles and microbial adhesion, the importance of oil phase selection based on physicochemical compatibility, and strategies for process integration to optimize yields and enable interface reuse. By aligning interfacial chemistry with metabolic and recovery engineering, w/O Pickering systems emerge as viable alternatives for scalable, sustainable bioprocesses involving hydrophobic substrates, with relevance to pharmaceuticals, polymer synthesis, and environmental applications. the review aims to bridge gaps in understanding how to systematically design these emulsions for integrated bioprocessing, focusing on hydrophobic-phase design, catalytic interface stability, yield improvement, and easier downstream recovery.},

The layer of nanoparticles at the interface of Pickering droplets is a semi-permeable barrier between the two liquid phases, which can affect the rate of release of encapsulates, and the interfacial transfer of reactants and products in biphasic chemical conversion. A gap in our fundamental understanding of diffusion in multiphase systems with particle-laden interfaces currently limits the optimal development of these applications. To address this gap, we developed an experimental approach for               in situ               , real-time quantification of concentration fields in Pickering droplets in a Hele-Shaw geometry and investigated the effect of the layer of nanoparticles on diffusion of solute across a liquid–liquid interface. The experiments did not reveal a significant hindrance on the diffusion of solute across an interface densely covered by nanoparticles. We interpret this result using an unsteady diffusion model to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the concentration of solute with a particle-laden interface. We find that the concentration field is only affected in the immediate vicinity of the layer of particles, where the area available for diffusion is affected by the particles. This defines a characteristic time scale for the problem, which is the time for diffusion across the layer of particles. The far-field concentration profile evolves towards that of a bare interface. This localized effect of the particle hindrance is not measurable in our experiments, which take place over a much longer time scale. Our model also predicts that the hindrance by particles can be more pronounced depending on the particle size and physicochemical properties of the liquids and can ultimately affect performance in applications.},

Temperature-responsive poly(               N               -isopropylacrylamide) microgels modified with 1-benzyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide (pNIPAM-               co               -BVI) are synthesized in varying sizes and used to stabilise jojoba oil-in-water concentrated emulsions. The results reveals two distinct behaviours: for small microgels (∼300 nm), the PEs exhibit a smooth, uniform structure characterised by a mild yield stress, characteristic of soft glassy systems. Conversely, larger microgels (∼800 nm) induce droplet clustering, resulting in increased elasticity and a more complex yielding process. Interestingly, transdermal delivery tests demonstrate that microstructure, rather than bulk rheology, governs sustained drug release. The release process can be modelled as diffusion-controlled transport through a porous medium with random traps. At room temperature, the trap size corresponds to the droplet size, and the release time scales with the total dispersed phases volume fraction. However, at physiological temperature (37 °C), above the volume-phase transition temperature of the microgels, the release time increases significantly. The trap size approaches the microgel size, suggesting that microgel porosity becomes the dominant factor controlling drug release. Overall, the results highlight the critical role of microstructure design in optimising stimuli-responsive PEs for controlled transdermal drug delivery.},

The present study considers various food-relevant emulsifiers known to form colloidal particles in aqueous solutions. These range from a low molecular weight surfactant and protein polyelectrolytes, to biopolymer complexes and solid particles: sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL); bovine serum albumin (BSA); sodium caseinate (NaCAS), chitosan (Ch); BSA/Ch or NaCAS/Ch complexes; and silica (Pickering) nanoparticles (A200), were all investigated. In all cases, DMP release from the oil droplets of the o/w emulsions was controlled by the interfacial transport of the active rather than by its diffusion through the globules’ interior. Release data followed first-order kinetics, where emulsions stabilised by soft (protein/polysaccharide complexes) colloidal structures were shown to provide similar (528 nm2 s−1) or even lower interfacial rate constants (241 nm2 s−1) to harder (silica) particulate entities (625 nm2 s−1). SSL (a lamellar-phase forming surfactant that has been previously suggested to stabilise o/w emulsions via a mechanism closely resembling that of Pickering particles) exhibited the lowest interfacial release rate (17 nm2 s−1). Overall, the present study contributes to current understanding on how emulsion interfacial architecture can be controlled to provide desirable molecular release performances.},

  abstract = {Pickering emulsion, a kind of emulsion stabilized only by solid particles locating at oil–water interface, has been discovered a century ago, while being extensively studied in recent decades. Substituting solid particles for traditional surfactants, Pickering emulsions are more stable against coalescence and can obtain many useful properties. Besides, they are more biocompatible when solid particles employed are relatively safe in vivo. Pickering emulsions can be applied in a wide range of fields, such as biomedicine, food, fine chemical synthesis, cosmetics, and so on, by properly tuning types and properties of solid emulsifiers. In this article, we give an overview of Pickering emulsions, focusing on some kinds of solid particles commonly serving as emulsifiers, three main types of products from Pickering emulsions, morphology of solid particles and as-prepared materials, as well as applications in different fields.},

  abstract = {Pickering emulsions can be utilized to improve the usage efficiency of water-insoluble drugs as oral drug delivery systems. The present study showed a series of dopamine-functionalized pectin-based Pickering emulsions for anti-inflammatory medication. The dopamine functionalization induced significant differences in wettability, zeta potential, particle size, and PDI value compared with the oxidized pectin. The resultant Pickering emulsions consequently had excellent stability and could be stored for 30 days. Moreover, the morphology of the dried Pickering emulsions was all nano-scale spherical particles. Indomethacin (IND) was used as a water-insoluble drug model. The resultant Pickering emulsion-based drug delivery system showed persistent release of IND for more than 12 h, high pH-responsiveness, and biocompatibility. All the results manifested the excellent potential of dopamine-functionalized pectin-based Pickering emulsions in drug delivery applications. The present work also provided a new approach to preparing Pickering emulsions from modified anionic polysaccharides for delivering the water-insoluble drugs.},
